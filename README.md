Music Generation Project
Description:
The Music Generation Project is a data-driven endeavor to generate musical compositions using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes MIDI files containing musical data, extracting patterns and structures to generate new musical sequences. Various machine learning models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are trained on MIDI data to learn musical patterns and generate new compositions automatically.

Key Components:
Data Collection and Preparation:

MIDI files are collected from the MAESTRO dataset, containing classical piano performances.
Data preprocessing involves parsing MIDI files, extracting musical notes, and organizing them into sequences suitable for training.
Model Development:

LSTM-based neural networks are utilized to capture temporal dependencies in the musical data.
The model architecture includes input layers for sequence data, LSTM layers for learning patterns, and output layers for generating new sequences.
Training and Evaluation:

The models are trained on the MIDI data, optimizing for accuracy in predicting musical sequences.
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) are employed to assess model performance.
Music Generation:

Trained models are used to generate new musical sequences based on learned patterns.
Generated sequences are converted back to MIDI format for playback and analysis.
Technical Skills Utilized:
Data preprocessing techniques for parsing MIDI files and extracting musical features.
Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow for building and training LSTM-based models.
Python programming for implementing the project components.
Signal processing techniques for analyzing and manipulating musical data.
